This is a very simple 1 minute tracking toward the first two videos.

This is only a quick result in order for others to start working on some following tasks. You can use the output 2D points directly for 3D reconstruction, etc.

To make it simple, I trim in one-minute scope from each video. I started trimming 1-2 seconds before the drone moving. Of course the two trimmed video are not synchronized and I believe you should work on it.

If you want to run the code, you only need to have pyhton and openCV downloaded. By running the code, you can see how the template matching works and how does the trajectory looks like.
